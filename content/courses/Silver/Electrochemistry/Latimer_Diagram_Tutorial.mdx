### How to utilize Latimer Diagrams

Latimer Diagrams can be a great tool for many things, but it is most commonly used to predict **disproportionation** and **comproportionation** reactions. Let's first go over what these mean:


*   **Disproportionation**: When a reactant is simultaneously oxidized and reduced to form two different products
*   **Comproportionation**: When two reactants (with the same element but different oxidation number) forms one product (with the same element and oxidation number)

A latimer diagram can be very useful as it illustrates all of the standard potentials for different oxidation states of the same element. For example, the Latimer diagram of Manganese is shown below:

**Latimer diagrams** are **no different **from the standard potential tables that you’ve learned about in electrochemistry. Because many of these reactions involve H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>−</sup>, and some species may only be stable in certain pH conditions, it is crucial for latimer diagrams to state whether it is in acidic or basic conditions.

Let’s use MnO<sub>4<sup>−</sup></sub> → MnO<sub>2</sub> as an example. We’ve taken a look at this half-reaction before, and the standard potential was provided above. Before you take a peak, try balancing this half-reaction.

For convenience, the balanced equation is provided below:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>MnO<sub>4<sup>−</sup></sub> + 4 H<sup>+</sup> + 3 e<sup>−</sup> → MnO<sub>2</sub> (s) + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O
   </td>
   <td>E° = +1.69
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Doesn’t this seem very similar? Indeed, besides the omission of H<sup>+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and electron transfer count, it is exactly the same thing. This is true for all other values as well, and you should be able to balance all of the half-reactions when given the species in the latimer diagram.

Now why is this relevant?



*   If the left value is** greater than **the right value, **comproportionation occurs**.
*   If the left value is **less than** the right value, **disproportionation occurs**.

This might be confusing, but an example should clear things up. Take a look at **manganate**, or MnO<sub>4<sup>2−</sup></sub>. We can see that the left value is **less than **the right value, so we would expect **disproportionation **to occur. Meaning, MnO<sub>4<sup>2−</sup></sub> would spontaneously decompose into **permanganate **(MnO<sub>4<sup>−</sup></sub>) and **manganese(IV) oxide** (MnO<sub>2</sub>). 

Here’s another example. Take a look at **manganese(IV) oxide**. The left value is **larger than** the right value, so we expect **comproportionation **to occur. Meaning, if we were to mix **manganate**(MnO<sub>4<sup>2−</sup></sub>) and **Manganese(III)** (Mn<sup>3+</sup>), they would react to form MnO<sub>2</sub>.
