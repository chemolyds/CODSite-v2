# CODS Competitor's Guide

**By Nicolai Bogo Stabell (Stabell#6680) & Kwanwoo Park (fizzest#0001)**

_Version 2.0 (August 29th, 2022)_

_**Author Note:**_
_The guide is an ambitious attempt to cover everything that a competitor needs to know about our competition structures._
_This guide is written as detailed as possible for the competitor to reference._

_**Jeremy's Note:**_
_The guide on the website (you're reading it!) is not guaranteed to be as complete or up-to-date as the google docs._
_As such, please check the [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZrtjxHsUekPtpQzbd5uhMrVIwIyaVwj3Lx527ll1Ldk/edit)._

# Introduction

With the beginning of the 2021-22 season, CODS will adopt a new system, taking into consideration what we've learned from our past competitions.
CODS will host four competitions every season, which will begin in Autumn and end during the summer.
Each competition will have its own unique characteristics, and will be widely accessible to competitors at any skill level.


# The Tier System & Syllabus

New to the 2021-22 season, CODS is introducing a new **tier system**.
Our tier system is inspired by the one used in the United States of America Computing Olympiad (USACO).
The goal of the tier system is to create more differentiation in our competitions, allowing more people to participate at a level that is appropriate for them.
Differentiation has not previously been possible in the old competition structure, in which competitions' difficulty tended to increase throughout the season, leading to a gradual decrease in participation.

We define three new tiers, **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**.

Each tier will have different exams for competitions (with the exception of SOCC) that correspond to a set difficulty.
In the following, we describe the syllabus of the three tiers for competitors to study.
CODS will be dedicating much of the **website development** this year to providing high-quality learning materials for the specific topics illustrated below, similar in nature to [USACO guides](https://usaco.guide/).


## Bronze Tier

The Bronze TIer is the entry tier at which every person competing in a CODS Competition begins.
The average difficulty and problem-solving level for the bronze tier is around USNCO Locals.
We want all competitions to be somewhat challenging for newcomers, although the concepts involved should be relatively straightforward.

## Silver Tier

The Silver Tier is a tier higher than the Bronze Tier.
The average difficulty and problem-solving level for the silver tier should be between USNCO Nationals Part II and WCC.
It can involve any topics in the bronze tier and the advanced topics listed below, such as Organic Chemistry (although limited to knowledge you can find in Klein's Organic Chemistry).

## Gold Tier

The Gold Tier is the highest proposed tier for CODS Competitions.
The average difficulty and problem-solving level for the gold tier should be between IChO to Mendeleev (IMChO) difficulty.
It should involve a more sophisticated level of advanced topics and should be very challenging.
Therefore, the syllabus for gold tier is the current or last year's IChO and IMChO preparatory problems and exams.


## Promotion, Demotion, Decay

In each competition, promotion and demotion can occur.

| **Tier** | **Promotion Requirement** | **Demotion Requirement*** | **Decay** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Bronze** | 15% | - | - |
| **Silver** | 10% | 5% | 4 |
| **Gold** | - | 10% | 2 |

For example, **Silver participants** who place within the **Top 10%** of any competition will be promoted to the **Gold tier**.
Additionally, silver participants who do not compete in four consecutive CODS competitions in a row will be subjected to demotion (decayed) to the lower tier.

If the number of participants in a tier results in a fractional number of participants to be promoted or demoted, the number is rounded to the nearest integer.

*In the case that the total number of participants in a tier who took the competition's exam is 9 or lower, no participants will be demoted.

# Competitions

All competitions will have a **Main round** for all participants and a **Final round** for participants who do  exceptionally well.
The very best total scorers receive awards, diplomas, and even a promotion to the next tier.

## Autumn Chemistry Online Tournament (ACOT)

The first competition of each year will be our autumn competition, which tests on your skill of both speed and accuracy.

In the **main round**, all participants will take a 20-question multiple choice exam within 60 minutes.
Questions in the multiple choice exam may have **multiple answers**.
Guessing or incorrect answers will be penalized in the main round.
Each participant’s score is composed of **accuracy** (80%) and time of completion, also known as **speed** (20%).
More information about our mathematical model can be found in the [ACOT 2022 Rulebook](https://tinyurl.com/acotrulebook2022).

The **final round** will be **4 free response questions with multiple parts.**
Each tier will have an Organic, Inorganic, Analytical, and Physical Chemistry question.
The participants will have up to 120 minutes to complete the round.
The score for this round will similarly be calculated from the time taken and the score.


## Winter Chemistry Competition (WCC)

In the **main round** of our winter competition, participants will be teaming in teams of four in a three round competition.
You **may** team with team members from different tiers; however, your team will be taking the exam of the **highest tier member**.

In the **first round**, the team will split up and take a 90 minute **individual exam**.
In the **second round**, bronze and silver teams will work for 120 minutes in a closed-book **team exam**; gold teams will work together for 4 hours in an open internet exam (e.g. Open Round from SOCC '21).
Both rounds and all tiers will consist of four questions, one of each of the following topics: physical, inorganic, organic, and analytical chemistry.
To see what type of questions gold participants are expected to be asked during the open round, refer to our SOCC '21 Open Round exam.

The **final round** will be **Cleaving Bonds**, a fast-paced teamwork competition with **live-scoring present**. Each team will be given twelve rounds of three short-answer questions that become increasingly difficult with only 90 minutes on the clock. As all teams work through their rounds, their scores will be graded live on the spot during the competition, making it very exciting to watch as both a participant and a spectator.

## Spring Open Chemistry Competition (SOCC)

SOCC will be whenever the mock USNCO is held.

For the **main round**, all participants will take the same **USNCO National Part I style** (60 multiple-choice questions, 90 minutes) exam.

Participants that do exceptionally well will advance to the final round to take a **USNCO National Part II style** (8 free-response questions, 105 minutes) exam, and participants will be awarded with awards and prizes!

## Summer Chemistry Olympiad (SChO, 2022)

SChO is our summer competition, based on the IChO (International Chemistry Olympiad) structure. Unlike our other competitions, there is only **one round** for the SChO and all the problems are free responses. The exam format depends on the tier a competitor chooses to participate in:

| **Tier** | **# of Questions (Time)**|**Difficulty**|**Promotion Requirement**|**Demotion Requirement** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Bronze** | 4 (120 min) | Introduction to competitive chemistry | 15% | - |
| **Silver** | 7 (210 min) | Slightly harder than WCC Part II | 10% | 5% |
| **Gold** | 9 (300 min) | IChO / Mendeleev Olympiad Difficulty | - | 10% |


# Testing

This year, we are offering two types of proctoring for all competitions:
<ul>
	<li> **Physical** proctoring (in-person proctoring with a school administrator, teacher, or tutor; choice of print or computer exam format) </li>
	<li> **Online** proctoring (online proctoring with video and screen recording, computer exam format) </li>
</ul>

Physical participants are able to take any given exam (with their proctor) any time during a **7-day window**, a full Monday-Sunday week. Online participants are able to take the exam any time during **the last 48-hours** of this window, Saturday-Sunday. Some competition rounds, such as Cleaving Bonds, may be limited in time slots due to the nature of the competition.
Some competitions, such as Cleaving Bonds, may be limited in time slots due to the nature of the competition.

Participants will be **required** to have a functioning webcam (for workspace) and a phone or scanner to scan their **hand-written** answers for submission.
**Video proctoring** will not be done on Discord, but on the testing website itself.
**Multi-accounting** is considered **cheating** and will be a **network-bannable offense**.
While we cannot go over the handful of cheating protocols and new tools to detect cheating for obvious reasons, testing security is a big focus in CODS competitions and any evidence that confirms cheating will be taken seriously and punished.
The specifics of rules in each competition will be introduced in much more detail later on.
